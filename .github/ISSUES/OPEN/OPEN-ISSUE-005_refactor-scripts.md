# Refactoring Goal: Scripts

Target: `/scripts`

## Objectives
- [ ] Analyze contents of `scripts/` (background, content, analytics)
- [ ] Evaluate if `analytics` should be a Feature (`features/analytics`)
- [ ] Document strict responsibilities of Background vs Content scripts
- [ ] Ensure `background.js` is merely an orchestrator (thin layer)
- [ ] **Security:** Verify "World Isolation" (Main World vs Isolated World) to prevent page interference (Anti-pattern: Global Scope Pollution).
